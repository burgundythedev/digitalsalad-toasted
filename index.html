    <p>Once upon a time, in the urban jungle of Paris. A guy named Pierre, who had never get his salad toasted , met online a nice girl.
      After several dates, he asked her if she likes Salad ? The eyebrows's girl started to go crazy and she responded straight up: "Sure !! I'm Vegetarian for life" "Word up!!"
      Amazed by her answer: Pierre, the guy with a big & salty salad, show his most beautiful "Batavia" like a Peacock show off his feathers. And they lived happily and the most important Vegetarian ever after.
